## ðŸ’» What it does
RecycleMe allows users to locate the nearest trash cans through 3 types of data:
- the nearest recycling centers via the google maps api
- user-generated data of trash cans nearby and what materials it recycles
- local businesses which provides more specific types of data that they specifically could recycle
