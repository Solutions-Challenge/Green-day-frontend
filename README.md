RecycleMe is a trash categorization tool used to make recycling more quick and convenient. The user can take a picture of a certain item and our ML will determine its recyclability and where to recycle it. Our map takes in a collection of data from the Google Maps API and user-generated data by both our standard users and by businesses.

## ðŸ’» What it does
RecycleMe allows users to locate the nearest trash cans through 3 types of data:
- the nearest recycling centers via the google maps api
- user-generated data of trash cans nearby and what materials it recycles
- local businesses which provides more specific types of data that they specifically could recycle
